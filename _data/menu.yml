      - title: I'm a tinkerer who (sometimes) gets obsessively interested in certain topics. During the day, I work with pixels and polygons to solve geospatial AI problems with a focus on concrete impact. In my spare time, you might find me learning from others, building PoCs, and sharing my discoveries.
