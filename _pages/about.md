Akram Zaytar is a Senior Applied Research Scientist at the [Microsoft AI for Good Research Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ai-for-good-research-lab/). His work leverages satellite imagery, computer vision, and data science to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, including climate change and food security.

Before joining Microsoft, Akram Zaytar completed his postdoctoral research at IBM Research where he focused on GeoSpatial Machine learning and applied research. During his time there, he worked on projects including crop mapping at national scales by fusing multiple satellite bands, quantifying the role of extreme weather events on agricultural yield variation, and post-processing ECMWF forecasts using probabilistic ML models.

Akram has a strong interest in GeoSpatial machine learning, deep neural networks, foundation models, and self/weakly-supervised learning.
