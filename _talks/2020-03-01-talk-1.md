African smallholder farmers face considerable difficulties in coping up with the unpredictable nature of farming conditions (e.g., environment, weather & soil). For them, making uninformed decisions often decreases the productivity of their farms and hence their livelihoods. In this presentation, we go over our past, current, and future research efforts that aim at aiding smallholder farmers in Africa. Using a range of data types contextualized to form digital twins of farms, we present a method for recommending cultivation time-windows for plowing and a scalable approach for weakly-supervised small-scale boundary estimation.
