Hello, friends! Here's a quick roundup of articles I found interesting this week. Enjoyâ€”and if anything sparks your curiosity, give it a read!

- **[Using LLMs and Cursor to become a finisher](https://zohaib.me/using-llms-and-cursor-for-finishing-projects-productivity)**  
  A handy LLM-centric approach for automating software engineering projects. If you're a chronic starter who struggles to wrap things up, this might inspire you to cross the finish line.
- **[On mental health, psychedelics and life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jBoSEVlryiX1IaSzV4vKuihDfm_LgXUznvSpl1T1kg/edit?tab=t.0)**  
  A sobering story highlighting the dangers of experimenting with certain substances. It's an eye-opening reminder of how mental health struggles can take unexpected turns.
- **[Situational Awareness](https://situational-awareness.ai/)**  
  Covers everything from AI scaling hypotheses and potential intelligence explosions to alignment issues and security concerns. Some of the takes are pretty bold, but it's a neat primer on where AGI might be headed.
- **[How to be Happy?](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oi873FWi6pHWxswSa/p/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9)**  
  A list of practical pointers for boosting your well-being. Simple tips, but sometimes the basics are all we need to feel happier.
- **[2024 Letter](https://zhengdongwang.com/2024/12/29/2024-letter.html)**  
  A fun look at the state of large language models, how we evaluate them, and what the future might hold.
- **[How to be a wise optimist about science and technology?](https://michaelnotebook.com/optimism/index.html)**  
  Love this one for [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/)'s draft-like, raw style. It wrestles with the ups and downs of advanced technology and shows how complex these big questions can be.
